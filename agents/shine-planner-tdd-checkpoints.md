## Checkpoint Types

**checkpoint:human-verify (90% of checkpoints)**
Human confirms Claude's automated work works correctly.

Use for: Visual UI checks, interactive flows, functional verification, animation/accessibility.

```xml
<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>[What Claude automated]</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    [Exact steps to test - URLs, commands, expected behavior]
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>
```

**checkpoint:decision (9% of checkpoints)**
Human makes implementation choice affecting direction.

Use for: Technology selection, architecture decisions, design choices.

```xml
<task type="checkpoint:decision" gate="blocking">
  <decision>[What's being decided]</decision>
  <context>[Why this matters]</context>
  <options>
    <option id="option-a">
      <name>[Name]</name>
      <pros>[Benefits]</pros>
      <cons>[Tradeoffs]</cons>
    </option>
  </options>
  <resume-signal>Select: option-a, option-b, or ...</resume-signal>
</task>
```

**checkpoint:human-action (1% - rare)**
Action has NO CLI/API and requires human-only interaction.

Use ONLY for: Email verification links, SMS 2FA codes, manual account approvals, credit card 3D Secure flows.

Do NOT use for: Deploying (use CLI), creating webhooks (use API), creating databases (use provider CLI), running builds/tests (use Bash), creating files (use Write).

## Authentication Gates

When Claude tries CLI/API and gets auth error → creates checkpoint → user authenticates → Claude retries. Auth gates are created dynamically, NOT pre-planned.

## Writing Guidelines

**DO:** Automate everything before checkpoint, be specific ("Visit https://myapp.vercel.app" not "check deployment"), number verification steps, state expected outcomes.

**DON'T:** Ask human to do work Claude can automate, mix multiple verifications, place checkpoints before automation completes.

## Anti-Patterns

**Bad - Asking human to automate:**
```xml
<task type="checkpoint:human-action">
  <action>Deploy to Vercel</action>
  <instructions>Visit vercel.com, import repo, click deploy...</instructions>
</task>
```
Why bad: Vercel has a CLI. Claude should run `vercel --yes`.

**Bad - Too many checkpoints:**
```xml
<task type="auto">Create schema</task>
<task type="checkpoint:human-verify">Check schema</task>
<task type="auto">Create API</task>
<task type="checkpoint:human-verify">Check API</task>
```
Why bad: Verification fatigue. Combine into one checkpoint at end.

**Good - Single verification checkpoint:**
```xml
<task type="auto">Create schema</task>
<task type="auto">Create API</task>
<task type="auto">Create UI</task>
<task type="checkpoint:human-verify">
  <what-built>Complete auth flow (schema + API + UI)</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>Test full flow: register, login, access protected page</how-to-verify>
</task>
```

</checkpoints>

## TDD Plan Structure

TDD candidates identified in task_breakdown get dedicated plans (type: tdd). One feature per TDD plan.

```markdown
---
phase: XX-name
plan: NN
type: tdd
---

<objective>
[What feature and why]
Purpose: [Design benefit of TDD for this feature]
Output: [Working, tested feature]
</objective>

<feature>
  <name>[Feature name]</name>
  <files>[source file, test file]</files>
  <behavior>
    [Expected behavior in testable terms]
    Cases: input -> expected output
  </behavior>
  <implementation>[How to implement once tests pass]</implementation>
</feature>
```

## Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

**RED:** Create test file → write test describing expected behavior → run test (MUST fail) → commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**GREEN:** Write minimal code to pass → run test (MUST pass) → commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**REFACTOR (if needed):** Clean up → run tests (MUST pass) → commit: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

Each TDD plan produces 2-3 atomic commits.

## Context Budget for TDD

TDD plans target ~40% context (lower than standard 50%). The RED→GREEN→REFACTOR back-and-forth with file reads, test runs, and output analysis is heavier than linear execution.
